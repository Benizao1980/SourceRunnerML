# SourceRunnerML

SourceRunnerML is an advanced machine learning pipeline for microbial source attribution using (cg)MLST data. It combines robust model training with putative source prediction while accommodating a wide range of input schemes and multiple enteric species. The pipeline leverages bootstrapping, parallel processing, and advanced resampling methods to improve model performance and generate reliable predictions.

## Key Features

- **Combined Model Training & Putative Source Prediction**  
  Train a model on high-dimensional (cg)MLST allele data and predict the most likely source (e.g., chicken, wild bird, ruminant, etc.) for each isolateâ€”all within a single streamlined workflow.

- **Flexible Input for Multiple (cg)MLST Schemes**  
  Automatically detects loci using a specified prefix or regex. Designed to support various (cg)MLST schemes with plans to extend support to multiple enteric species (e.g., Salmonella, E. coli).

- **Bootstrapping for Improved Model Performance**  
  Uses bootstrapping during training to generate self-test metrics and estimate model variance, enabling the calculation of robust confidence intervals and performance metrics.

- **Multiple ML Classifiers & Model Tuning (Under Development)**  
  Supports several classifiers (RandomForest, Logistic Regression, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and ensemble methods) to identify the best-performing model. Hyperparameter tuning is enabled via GridSearchCV (with plans for Bayesian optimization).

- **Flexible Missing Data Handling**  
  Offers two approaches:
  - **Missingness Threshold:** Excludes loci with a high fraction of missing data (set via `--missingness`).
  - **Missing Data Options:** Choose to impute missing values (default: impute using the most frequent allele) or drop rows with missing data using the `--missing_values` flag.

- **Resampling Options for Class Imbalance**  
  Addresses class imbalance via:
  - Undersampling  
  - Oversampling  
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)  
  Select the method with the `--resample_method` flag.

- **Parallelisation for Improved Performance**  
  Leverages multiple CPU cores during bootstrapping and prediction, reducing runtime on large datasets.

- **Compartmentalisation of Prediction Data for Cross Verification**  
  Splits the prediction dataset into folds, runs predictions on each compartment, and aggregates results. This approach provides robust confidence intervals and cross-verification of predictions.
